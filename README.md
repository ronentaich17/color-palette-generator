 this program generates color palettes based on color schemes chosen by the user. 
 the files serve the following purposes:
 colors.h - header file that contains the algorithms that generate the colors
 selection.h - header file that contains functions that call the color algorithms and
 format their output when chosen on the main menu
 main.cpp - contains code for the main menu (for now, it is based on the command line)
