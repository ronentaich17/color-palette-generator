# color-palette-generator

## This is a project that generates hue-based color palettes off existing color schemes, such as complementary, tetradic and more!

This project is a collection of C++ algorithms that generate color palettes based on hue values given by the user. The program is run on the command line (for now) and will display a menu to the user, asking which color scheme they would like their color pallette to be based on. After selecting their desired color scheme, the user will then enter a "base hue", which will then serve as the basis for the other colors generated by the algorithm.

Right now, I have plans to add a user interface to the program and change the colors displayed from being hue-based to RGB. I am also still experimenting with the design of the algorithms and how they can be improved

Here are the color schemes that the algorithms are based on:

### Complementary

Complementary color schemes draw from two colors on opposite ends of the color wheel. Usually, this results in two colors that compliment each other well
contrast-wise. An example of this would be orange and blue.

### Analogous

Analogous colors are comprsied of groups of colors that are next to each other on the color wheel. Usually, it is made up of three colors but doesn't
necessarily limited to that. Sometimes, it can go up to four or five colors. An example of this would be green-yellow-orange.

### Triadic

Triadic colors are made up of three colors such that they are all equidistant from one another on the color wheel. An example of such a color
scheme would be red-yellow-blue.

### Monochromatic

Monochromatic colors are made up of a singular color. It only uses variations of that colors hue, which is made by altering the brightness and
satruation of that color. An example of something that uses a monochromatic color scheme would be the grayscale.

### Tetradic

Tetradic colors are two sets of complimentary colors that are found on opposite ends of the color wheel. Using such a technique tends to provide a good
balance between warm and cool colors. An example of this would be blue-orange and green-red

While I do want to add more color schemes, my main goal for this project right now is adding a user interface and improving the algorithms for the color
schemes mentioned above. Thanks for reading!
